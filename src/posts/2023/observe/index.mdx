  > `observation` The **Creator** is more advanced than the **Creature**

  - The Creature is not greater than the Creator
  - Software engineer (a creator) writes a program (a creature):
    - A program operates with the concepts inherent to an engineer
    - The concepts might be math, words, etc.
    - The program may do operations faster or with higher precision than an engineer, however, it can't jump out of the concept
      - A program might calculate the factorial faster, but it will still be operating in the math concept
    - For the program to start operating with a new concept, the latter must be introduced to it by the engineer
      - A program may start creating music, but only after the concept of music was introduced to it by the creator (engineer)
  - If a human being (a creature) has a concept of consciousness and feelings, then these concepts are inherent to his/her creator
    - The Creator has consciousness and feelings
    - It is not just a gravity or an electricity or an abstract force
