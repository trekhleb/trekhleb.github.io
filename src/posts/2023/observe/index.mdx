      ## We are like **2D** people trying to grasp the **3D** ideas
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - Imagine a world of 2D people
        - They operate with 2D concepts of circles, rectangles, triangles, <Math>XY</Math>-axis, etc.
        - But they also want to grasp 3D concepts like a cylinder or torus
        - When a 3D cylinder intersects the 2D world its section might look different: from a circle, through an ellipse, to a square
        - When a 3D torus intersects the 2D world it sometimes is seen by the 2D people as one ellipse or sometimes as two independent circles, or sometimes as one circle inside another
        - Some 2D people may say that there is no such concept as a cylinder, but there are only concepts of circles and squares
        - Some 2D people may say that there is a concept of a cylinder, but a cylinder itself is not more than a circle
        - The idea that a cylinder can be a circle and a square at the same time might sound contradictive to the 2D people
      - We're in a similar situation, except we're 4D people (let's say we have <Math>XYZ</Math> + Time) trying to think about higher dimensions
        - We live in a lower-dimension (closed or limited) system
        - Spirituality might be such a higher dimension

      ## We are like a **fetus** in a mother's belly trying to think about **life after birth**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - How hard is it for a baby inside a mother's belly to think about the outside-belly world?
      - Is there a life after birth?
      - Is it hard for a fetus to grasp the concept of higher education, for example?

      ## Every physical object that we can grasp has an **origin** or a **cause**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - We can continue asking the "What was before" or "What caused it" questions until we stuck
      - Example
        - A program has been created by an engineer on the laptop while drinking a lemon tea
          - An engineer has been "created" by his/her father and mother
            - Engineer's mother was "created" by an engineer's grandma and grandpa
              - ...
          - A laptop was created by another engineer out of many pieces
            - Some pieces were created out of silicon
              - ...
          - A lemon tree grew from a seed
            - A seed was produced by a grand-tree
              - Lemons are a hybrid of citrons and bitter oranges
                - ...
      - There is no object that we know or understand appeared out of nothing

      ## Science doesn't have an answer to the question of **ultimate origin** for now
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - We can continue asking the "What was before X" or "What caused X" questions until we stuck
      - We are normally stuck at <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_singularity">Initial Singularity</Link> or at the <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Big Bang</Link> level
        - "The universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature, approximately 13.8 billion years ago"
      - The following remain unanswered:
        - How the laws of the universe that singularity followed were created
          - How was it possible to operate with such concepts as temperature and density
          - In other words, where did the <Math>E = mc<sup>2</sup></Math> equation came from (or String Theory equation)
        - How the components (parts) of the singularity were created
        - What is the origin of time
      - The singularity represents a fundamental gap in our knowledge
      - The Simulation Hypothesis or Multiverses idea doesn't answer the question of origin as well
        - It is not clear how was the root universe or root simulation created in this case

      ## In science, some **theories** are getting **reconsidered** over time
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - Science often operates with theories
        - *Theory of relativity*, *String theory*, *Quantum field theory*, *Big Bang theory*, *Field theory*, etc. (see <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics">60+ more central theories</Link>)
      - Some theories get reconsidered or rejected by scientists over time
        - *Geocentric Model*
          - For centuries, the prevailing view in astronomy was the geocentric model
          - The model proposed that Earth was at the center of the universe, and the sun, moon, planets, and stars revolved around it
        - *Steady-State Theory*
          - The steady-state theory was a cosmological model proposed in the mid-20th century as an alternative to the Big Bang Theory
          - It suggested that the universe was eternal and unchanging, with new matter continually being created to maintain a constant density.
          - However, the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 provided strong evidence in favor of the Big Bang theory and led to the decline of the steady-state theory.
        - *Static Universe Model*
          - Before the discovery of the expanding universe, it was widely believed that the universe was static and unchanging
          - However, Edwin Hubble's observations in the early 20th century provided evidence for the expanding universe, leading to the rejection of the static universe model
        - *Phlogiston Theory*
          - The phlogiston theory was a prominent explanation of combustion and oxidation in the 17th and 18th centuries
          - It proposed that a substance called phlogiston was released during combustion, which explained phenomena such as fire and the rusting of metals
          - The theory held that phlogiston was a weightless, colorless, and odorless substance that resided within combustible materials. When a substance burned, it was believed that the phlogiston was released into the air, leaving behind a residue known as the "calx" or "phlogisticated" substance.
          - The phlogiston theory explained why substances decreased in weight when burned since it was believed that phlogiston had negative weight. It also accounted for other phenomena such as the ability of metals to gain weight when they were calcined (heated) since it was thought that phlogiston was absorbed during this process
          - However, the theory was later discredited with the discovery of oxygen and the development of the modern understanding of oxidation and combustion
        - *Newtonian Mechanics*
          - In the early 20th century, the theory of relativity, introduced a new understanding of gravity and motion that superseded certain aspects of Newtonian mechanics
          - Relativity showed that Newton's laws were an approximation valid only under certain conditions

      ## In science, some **theories** are not **accepted** at first
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - *General Relativity Theory*
        - The theory was published by Albert Einstein in 1915
        - In the U.S., a few understood it, but, in general, relativity was ridiculed as “totally impractical and absurd.”
        - In Britain, his theories met with resistance, because relativity was seen as a direct challenge to the widely accepted theory of ether
        - Only around 1960 general relativity became central to physics and astronomy
      - *Plate Tectonics*
        - The theory of plate tectonics, which describes the movement of the Earth's lithosphere in plates, was initially met with skepticism when it was proposed in the early 20th century
        - It took several decades for accumulating evidence from geological studies, seismology, and oceanography to support the theory

      ## There is a **non-zero** chance that a scientific theory will be **reconsidered** or **rejected** in the future
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - A theory cannot be treated as an ultimate and unshakable truth
      - A theory is a way how we **currently** think about some phenomenon around us
      - A physical theory is our **current** attempt to describe and come up with a model of physical events around us
      - It is not wishful thinking though
        - A theory is judged by the extent to which its predictions agree with empirical observations
        - The quality of a physical theory is also judged by its ability to make new predictions which can be verified by new observations
      - Theory is like looking at the puzzling reflections in a broken mirror
        - By such fragmented reflections we may assume how the reflected world looks as a whole
        - But these assumptions might be incomplete or skewed
        - All that we know now is partial and incomplete
      - We, as human beings, are in the progress of describing the indescribable

      ## Science operates with **axioms** that need to be **believed** in
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - An *axiom* is a fundamental principle or statement that is taken to be true and is accepted without proof to serve as the starting point or a basis for a particular theory or system of thought
      - *Believing* refers to the acceptance of something as true, real, or valid without absolute proof or certainty
      - Examples
        - *Playfair's axiom*
          - In a plane, given a line and a point not on it, at most one line parallel to the given line can be drawn through the point
          - Sidenote
            - It is interesting, that we operate with absolutely ideal and abstract concepts like lines and points here
        - *Euclid's Parallel Postulate*
          - Similar to Playfair's axiom. If a line intersects two other lines and the interior angles on one side are less than two right angles, then the lines will eventually intersect if extended far enough
        - *Peano's Axioms*
          - A set of five axioms that provide a foundation for the natural numbers <Math>(0, 1, 2, 3, ...)</Math>. For example, the Axiom of Zero: there exists a number called <Math>0</Math>.
        - *Euclid's Common Notions*
          - Things equal the same thing also equal one another
          - If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal
          - If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal
          - Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another
          - The whole is greater than the part
        - *Axiom of Associativity*
          - This axiom states that the grouping of elements does not affect the result
          - <Math>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</Math>
          - <Math>(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)</Math>

      ## Every mathematical system relies on at least one **true** statement that **cannot** be proven
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - Gödel's theorems
        - *The 1st incompleteness theorem*
          - In any consistent formal system capable of expressing arithmetic, there are true statements that cannot be proven within the system itself
        - *The 2nd incompleteness theorem*
          - No consistent formal system capable of expressing arithmetic can prove its own consistency
      - Examples
        - *Goldbach's Conjecture*
          - Every even natural number greater than <Math>2</Math> is the sum of two prime numbers
        - *Fermat's Last Theorem (conjecture)*
          - No three positive integers <Math>a</Math>, <Math>b</Math>, and <Math>c</Math> satisfy the equation <Math>a<sup>n</sup> + b<sup>n</sup> = c<sup>n</sup></Math> for any integer value of <Math>n</Math> greater than <Math>2</Math>
        - *Twin Prime Conjecture*
          - There are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers <Math>(p, p+2)</Math> such that both <Math>p</Math> and <Math>p+2</Math> are prime. For example, the pair <Math>(3, 5)</Math>, <Math>(11, 13)</Math>, and <Math>(17, 19)</Math> are all twin prime pairs.
        - *Riemann hypothesis*, *Paris-Harrington Theorem*, etc.

      ## To answer the question of **origin** we need an axiom or a statement of the **Creator / Initiator /  Designer / God**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - We, as human beings, are living in a lower-dimension (closed or limited) system. See <Reference hash={SectionHash.AssumptionWB3} /> and <Reference hash={SectionHash.AssumptionBZ4} />
        - We might not be able to grasp the higher-dimension concepts clearly
        - We need abstractions that have connection points to our lower-dimension world to reason about higher-dimension concepts
          - For example, to reason about *time* it is helpful to draw it as a 2D calendar or a 1D timeline even though the concept of time is not that straightforward (think about its connection to gravity for example)
          - The same goes with such concept as *love*, which we express as simple actions, gifts, attention, sacrifice, etc.
          - You may think about 2D people trying to grasp the 3D cylinder that is passing via the 2D plane. They call it circles, squares and ellipses, but they ultimately try to reason about a cylinder
        - The same is true for the question of the origin, we might need to have a simplified abstraction that will help us to grasp at least some facet of such a higher-dimension concept
      - In mathematics, it is common to come up with axioms and statements that we believe to be true without any proof except intuition
        - Such statements help us build theories on top of them to explain the lower-dimension system around us
        - It might be unavoidable for us to follow a similar approach in answering the question of the origin
      - To answer the question of origin we need an axiom or a statement (a true statement that is not provable) or a "closing technology" of *God* / *The Initiator* / *The Creator* / *The Origin* / *The Designer*
        - The rest of our theories may be built on top of it: Singularity, BigBang, Cosmic Inflation, and so on...
      - The concept of *God* or the *Creator* is overloaded
        - Many cultural and religious concepts were attached to it
        - We need to avoid falling into the trap of unreasonable simplifications here and think broader
          - There are simplifications like "old grandpa sitting on the cloud"
          - We should rather remember the "2D-vs-3D Cylinder" example above

      ## **Spiritual** and **scientific** paths are not contradictory, but **convergent**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - *Mind* and *heart* paths are not contradictory, but convergent
        - We as human beings are guided by logic *and* intuition
        - It doesn't work seamlessly sometimes, but still, we treat logic and intuition as one system (as parts of one control panel)
      - It is like looking at the same thing from different perspectives
      - It is like converging to the same understanding of reality from different starting points
      - Both paths complement each other
      - *"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind"*, Albert Einstein <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein" asRef>1</Link>
        - The "religion" term is overloaded with tons of cultural meanings which skews our perception
        - To avoid this overloading trap, we may roughly use words like "heart", "intuition", "inspiration", or "imagination" here instead

      ## **Scientists'** quotes about the **Creator**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - **Michio Kaku** <Years>(Born: 1947)</Years>
        - *"I have concluded that we are in a world made by rules created by an intelligence... Believe me, everything that we call chance today won't make sense anymore. To me it is clear that we exist in a plan which is governed by rules that were created, shaped by a universal intelligence and not by chance."* <Link href="http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/42042/20160613/world-renowned-scientist-michio-kaku-proves-existence-god.htm" asRef>14</Link>

      - **Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.** <Years>(Born: 1941)</Years>
         - *"A scientific discovery is also a religious discovery. There is no conflict between science and religion. Our knowledge of God is made larger with every discovery we make about the world."* <Link href="https://www.azquotes.com/author/21977-Joseph_Hooton_Taylor_Jr" asRef>13</Link>

      - **Werner Heisenberg** <Years>(1901 — 1976)</Years>
        - *"The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you"* <Link href="https://www.google.nl/books/edition/God_Science_and_Society_The_Origin_of_th/0YDUDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0" asRef>3</Link>

      - **Albert Einstein** <Years>(1879 — 1955)</Years>
        - *"But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith. The situation may be expressed by an image: science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind"* <Link href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/OeUoXHoAJMsC?hl=en" asRef>1</Link>
        - Answering a question about whether or not he defined himself as a pantheist: *"Your question is the most difficult in the world. It is not a question I can answer simply with yes or no. I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations."* <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein" asRef>2</Link>
        - *"I have repeatedly said that in my opinion, the idea of a personal god is a childlike one. You may call me an agnostic, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being."* <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein" asRef>2</Link>
        - *"I am not an Atheist. In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what really makes me angry is that they quote me for the support of such views."* <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein" asRef>2</Link>
        - *"Scientific research can reduce superstition by encouraging people to think and view things in terms of cause and effect. Certain it is that a conviction, akin to religious feeling, of the rationality and intelligibility of the world lies behind all scientific work of a higher order. [...] This firm belief, a belief bound up with a deep feeling, in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God."* <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein" asRef>2</Link>
        - *"Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the actions of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a supernatural being. However, it must be admitted that our actual knowledge of these laws is only imperfect and fragmentary, so that, actually, the belief in the existence of basic all-embracing laws in nature also rests on a sort of faith. All the same, this faith has been largely justified so far by the success of scientific research. But, on the other hand, everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive"* <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein" asRef>2</Link>
        - *"God is a mystery. But a comprehensible mystery. I have nothing but awe when I observe the laws of nature. There are no laws without a lawgiver, but how does this lawgiver look? Certainly not like a man magnified."* <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_and_philosophical_views_of_Albert_Einstein" asRef>2</Link>

      - **Max Planck** <Years>(1858 — 1947)</Years>
        - *Both religion and science require a belief in God. For believers, God is in the beginning, and for physicists, He is at the end of all considerations. To the former, the God hypothesis is an essential prerequisite to any worldview worthy of being taken seriously, and to the latter, it is a matter of course that a purely mathematical worldview is a caricature.* <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck" asRef>11</Link>

      - **Louis Pasteur** <Years>(1822 — 1895)</Years>
        - *"The more I study nature, the more I stand amazed at the work of the Creator. Science brings men nearer to God."* <Link href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/575514" asRef>4</Link>
        - *"Too little science leads away from God, while too much science leads back to Him"* <Link href="https://en.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/la-mucha-ciencia-devuelve-a-dios" asRef>5</Link>


      - **Michael Faraday** <Years>(1791 — 1867)</Years>
        - *"The book of nature which we have to read is written by the finger of God."* <Link href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/694959" asRef>12</Link>

      - **Isaac Newton** <Years>(1642 — 1726)</Years>

      ## The **Creator** is more advanced than the **Creature**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - A creature is not greater than its creator
      - Software engineer (a creator) writes a program (a creature):
        - A program operates with the concepts inherent to an engineer (such as math, words, etc.)
        - The program may do operations faster or with higher precision than an engineer, however, it can't jump out of the available concepts
          - A program might calculate the factorial faster, but it will still be operating in the concept of math
        - For a program to start operating with a new concept, the latter must be introduced to it by an engineer
          - A program may start creating music, but only after the concept of music was introduced to it by the creator (engineer)
        - A program here operates in the lower-dimension (closed or limited) system that was set up for it by an engineer and a program cannot jump out of this lower-dimension system

    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - When a child is conceived, he/she inherits genetic material from father and mother
      - Each parent contributes roughly half of the child's genetic makeup
      - The specific parts of the father's and mother's genomes that a child inherits are determined by the process of genetic recombination, which occurs during the formation of eggs and sperm

      ## The **Creator** has **consciousness** and **feelings**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - If a human being (a creature) has a concept of consciousness and feelings, then these concepts are inherent to his/her creator
      - The Creator is not just gravity or electricity or an abstract force
      - Consciousness and feelings are just some of the concepts or features that we share with the Creator
      - The Creator might operate with some other concepts or features that we, as human beings, can't grasp. See the <Reference hash={SectionHash.AssumptionWB3} />

      ## In most movies **good** defeats **evil**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - In most movies, the traits of good are praised, and the traits of evil are there as a temporal antagonist till the good prevails or endures
        - Sometimes the distinguishment between good and evil is clear
          - *"A meek Hobbit from the Shire and eight companions set out on a journey to destroy the powerful One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron"*
        - Sometimes the good is placed in the negative context, like when telling the mafia story but still praising the good traits like loyalty, sacrifice, and saving loved ones
          - *"Don Vito Corleone, head of a mafia family, decides to hand over his empire to his youngest son Michael. However, his decision unintentionally puts the lives of his loved ones in grave danger."*
      - See <Link href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/">IMDb Charts</Link> for example
        - The Dark Knight
        - Schindler's List
        - The Lord of the Rings
        - The Matrix
        - Saving Private Ryan
        - Life Is Beautiful
        - Star Wars
        - WALL·E
        - etc.
      - The plot of the movie needs to resonate with the target audience, otherwise, the movie is going to be less profitable
        - Supply satisfies the demand

      ## Most human beings have embedded **good-vs-evil "sensor"**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - Most human beings can discern *good vs evil* from birth
        - Regardless of the culture, country, political or religious views, language, skin color or gender
        - Most people feel genuinely disgusted once encountered injustice, killing, raping, lying, betrayal, etc.
        - Most people genuinely admire true love, support, kindness, sacrifice, etc.
        - Even when doing wrong most people have an internal conflict or a conviction
      - This explains the demand for movies where good conquers evil in <Reference hash={SectionHash.ObservationUR9} />
