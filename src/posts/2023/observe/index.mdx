  - A creature is not greater than its creator
  - Software engineer (a creator) writes a program (a creature):
    - A program operates with the concepts inherent to an engineer
    - The concepts might be math, words, etc.
    - The program may do operations faster or with higher precision than an engineer, however, it can't jump out of the available concepts
      - A program might calculate the factorial faster, but it will still be operating in the math concept
    - For a program to start operating with a new concept, the latter must be introduced to it by an engineer
      - A program may start creating music, but only after the concept of music was introduced to it by the creator (engineer)
  - If a human being (a creature) has a concept of consciousness and feelings, then these concepts are inherent to his/her creator
    - The Creator has consciousness and feelings
    - The Creator is not just gravity or electricity or an abstract force
