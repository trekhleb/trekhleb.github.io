The statements below are my subjective observations, assumptions, questions, and interpretations about the world around us. They might be wrong. Don't take it seriously.

      We are like **2D** people trying to grasp the **3D** ideas
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - Imagine a world of 2D people
        - They operate with 2D concepts of circles, rectangles, triangles, XY-axis, etc.
        - But they also want to grasp 3D concepts like a cylinder or torus
        - When a 3D cylinder intersects the 2D world its section might look different: from a circle, through an ellipse, to a square
        - When a 3D torus intersects the 2D world it sometimes is seen by the 2D people as one ellipse or sometimes as two independent circles, or sometimes as one circle inside another
        - Some 2D people may say that there is no such concept as a cylinder, but there are only concepts of circles and squares
        - Some 2D people may say that there is a concept of a cylinder, but a cylinder itself is not more than a circle
        - The idea that a cylinder can be a circle and a square at the same time might sound contradictive to the 2D people
      - We're in a similar situation, except we're 4D people (let's say we have XYZ+Time) trying to think about higher dimensions
        - Spirituality might be such a higher dimension

      We are like a **fetus** in a mother's belly trying to think about **life after birth**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - How hard is it for a baby inside a mother's belly to think about the outside-belly world?
      - Is there a life after birth?
      - Is it hard for a fetus to grasp the concept of higher education, for example?

      Every physical object that we can grasp has an **origin** or a **cause**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - We can continue asking the "What was before" or "What caused it" questions until we stuck
      - Example
        - A program has been created by an engineer on the laptop while drinking a lemon tea
          - An engineer has been "created" by his/her father and mother
            - Engineer's mother was "created" by an engineer's grandma and grandpa
              - ...
          - A laptop was created by another engineer out of many pieces
            - Some pieces were created out of silicon
              - ...
          - A lemon tree grew from a seed
            - A seed was produced by a grand-tree
              - Lemons are a hybrid of citrons and bitter oranges
                - ...

      Science doesn't have an answer to the question of **ultimate origin** for now
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - We can continue asking the "What was before X" or "What caused X" questions until we stuck
      - We are normally stuck at <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_singularity">Initial Singularity</Link> or at the <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Big Bang</Link> level
        - "The universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature, approximately 13.8 billion years ago"
      - The following remain unanswered:
        - How the lows of the universe that singularity followed were created
          - How was it possible to operate with such concepts as temperature and density
        - How the components (parts) of the singularity were created
        - What is the origin of time
      - The singularity represents a fundamental gap in our knowledge

      The **Creator** is more advanced than the **Creature**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - A creature is not greater than its creator
      - Software engineer (a creator) writes a program (a creature):
        - A program operates with the concepts inherent to an engineer (such as math, words, etc.)
        - The program may do operations faster or with higher precision than an engineer, however, it can't jump out of the available concepts
          - A program might calculate the factorial faster, but it will still be operating in the concept of math
        - For a program to start operating with a new concept, the latter must be introduced to it by an engineer
          - A program may start creating music, but only after the concept of music was introduced to it by the creator (engineer)

      The **Creator** has **consciousness** and **feelings**
    </SectionHeader>
    <SectionBody>
      - If a human being (a creature) has a concept of consciousness and feelings, then these concepts are inherent to his/her creator
      - The Creator is not just gravity or electricity or an abstract force
      - Consciousness and feelings are just some of the concepts or features that we share with the Creator
      - The Creator might operate with some other concepts or features that we, as human beings, can't grasp. See the <Reference hash={SectionHash.Observation1} />
