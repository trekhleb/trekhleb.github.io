It will also learn how to generate different parts of recipes such as *📗 [RECIPE NAME]*, *🥕 [RECIPE INGREDIENTS]* and *📝 [RECIPE INSTRUCTIONS]*. Sometimes recipe name, ingredients and instructions will be pretty interesting, sometimes stupid, sometimes fun.\n\nHere is a couple of generated recipes examples:\n\n```text\n📗 [NAME]\n\nOrange Club Tea Sandwich Cookies\n\n🥕 [INGREDIENTS]\n\n• 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\n• 1 cup confectioners' sugar\n• 1/2 cup flaxseed meal\n• 1/2 cup shelled pumpkin seeds (pecans, blanched and sliced)\n• 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\n📝 [INSTRUCTIONS]\n\n▪︎ Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\n▪︎ Combine cake mix, milk, egg and sugar in a large bowl. Stir until combined and smooth but not sticky. Using a spatula, sprinkle the dough biscuits over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with sugar, and spread evenly. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. To serve, add the chocolate.\n```\n\nOr another one:\n\n```text\n📗 [NAME]\n\nMushrooms with Lentil Stewed Shallots and Tomatoes\n\n🥕 [INGREDIENTS]\n\n• 1 tablespoon olive oil\n• 3 cloves garlic, smashed\n• Kosher salt\n• 1 1/2 pounds lean ground turkey\n• 1 cup coarsely peeled tart apples\n• 2 tablespoons chopped garlic\n• 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n• 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n• 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme\n• 3/4 cup chopped fresh basil\n• 1/2 small carrot, halved lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n• 1 roasted red pepper, halved and sliced vertically diced and separated into rough chops\n• 3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n• 2 cups shredded mozzarella\n• 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese\n• 1/4 cup prepared basil pesto\n\n📝 [INSTRUCTIONS]\n\n▪︎ Stir the olive oil, garlic, thyme and 1 teaspoon salt in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat. Add the basil and toast the soup for 2 minutes.\n▪︎ Meanwhile, heat 4 to 4 inches vegetable oil in the skillet over medium-high heat.

The recipes are **not** for actual cooking!

It also might be beneficial to go through the [Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) article by *Andrej Karpathy*.\n\nOn a high level, **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to sequence-based data like speech, voice, text or music. They are used for machine translation, speech recognition, voice synthesis etc. The key feature of RNNs is that they are stateful, and they have an internal memory in which some context for the sequence may be stored. For example if the first word of the sequence was `He` the RNN might suggest the next word to `speaks` instead of just `speak` (to form a `He speaks` phrase) because the prior knowledge about the first word `He` is already inside the internal memory.\n\n![Recurrent Neural Network](assets/0.svg)\n\n> *Image source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)*\n\n![Basic architectures of GRU and LSTM cells](assets/1.png)\n\n> *Image source: [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21)*\n\nExciting part is that RNN (and LSTM in particular) could memorize not only *word-to-word* dependencies but also *character-to-character* dependencies! It doesn't really matter what sequence consists of: it might be words it might be characters. What is important is that they form a time-distributed sequence. For example, we have a sequence of characters `['H', 'e']`. If we ask LSTM what may go next it may suggest a `<stop_word>` (meaning, that the sequence that forms word `He` is already complete, and we may stop), or it may also suggest a character `l` (meaning, that it tries to build a `Hello` sequence for us). This type of RNNs are called **character-level RNNs** (as opposed to **word-level RNNs**).\n\nIn this tutorial we will rely on this memorization feature of RNN networks, and we will use a character-level version of LSTM to generate cooking recipes.\n\n## Exploring the datasets\n\nLet's go through several available datasets and explore their pros and cons. One of the requirements I want the dataset to meet is that it should have not only a list of ingredients but also a cooking instruction. I also want it to have a measures and quantities for each ingredient.\n\nHere are several cooking recipes datasets I've found:\n\n- 🤷 [Recipe Ingredients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset/home) *(doesn't have ingredients proportions)*\n- 🤷 [Recipe1M+](http://pic2recipe.csail.mit.edu/) *(a lot of recipes but requires registration to download)*\n- 🤷 [Epicurious - Recipes with Rating and Nutrition](https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes?select=full_format_recipes.json) *(~20k recipes only, it would be nice to find more)*\n- 👍🏻 [Recipe box](https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/) *(~125,000 recipes with ingredients proportions, good)*\n\nLet's try to use the \"Recipe box\" dataset. The number of recipes looks big enough, also it contains both ingredients and cooking instructions. It is interesting to see if RNN will be able to learn a connection between ingredients and instructions.\n\n## Setting TensorFlow/Python sandbox for training\n\nThere are several options you may follow to experiment with the code in this tutorial:\n\n1. You may experiment by using [GoogleColab right in your browser](https://colab.research.google.com/github/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/blob/master/experiments/recipe_generation_rnn/recipe_generation_rnn.ipynb) *(no local setup is needed)*.\n2. You may experiment by using [Jupyter notebook in Binder right in your browser](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/master?filepath=experiments/recipe_generation_rnn/recipe_generation_rnn.ipynb) *(no local setup is needed)*.\n3. You may [setup a Jupyter notebook locally](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments#how-to-use-this-repository-locally).\n\nI would suggest going with GoogleColab option since it doesn't require any local setup for you (you may experiment right in your browser), and it also provides a powerful GPU support for training that will make the model to train faster. You will be able to experiment with training parameters as well.\n\n## Importing dependencies\n\nLet's start with importing some packages that we will use afterwards.\n\n```python\n# Packages for training the model and working with the dataset.\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\n\n# Utility/helper packages.\nimport platform\nimport time\nimport pathlib\nimport os\n```\n\nFirst, let's make sure our environment is properly set up and that we're using a *2nd* version of Tensorflow.\n\n```python\nprint('Python version:', platform.python_version())\nprint('Tensorflow version:', tf.__version__)\nprint('Keras version:', tf.keras.__version__)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Python version: 3.7.6\n> Tensorflow version: 2.1.0\n> Keras version: 2.2.4-tf\n> ```\n\n## Loading the dataset\n\nLet's load the dataset using [tf.keras.utils.get_file](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/get_file). Using `get_file()` utility is convenient because it handles caching for you out of the box. It means that you will download the dataset files only once and then even if you launch the same code block in the notebook once again it will use cache, and the code block will be executed faster.\n\nCreate cache folder if it not exists:\n\n```python\nCACHE_DIR = './tmp'\npathlib.Path(CACHE_DIR).mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n```\n\nDownload and unpack the dataset:\n\n```python\ndataset_file_name = 'recipes_raw.zip'\ndataset_file_origin = 'https://storage.googleapis.com/recipe-box/recipes_raw.zip'\n\ndataset_file_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file(\n    fname=dataset_file_name,\n    origin=dataset_file_origin,\n    cache_dir=CACHE_DIR,\n    extract=True,\n    archive_format='zip'\n)\n\nprint(dataset_file_path)\n```\n\nHere is a path to dataset file after it has been downloaded:\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```shell\n> ./tmp/datasets/recipes_raw.zip\n> ```\n\nLet's print the cache folder and see what exactly has been downloaded:\n\n```shell\n!ls -la ./tmp/datasets/\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> total 521128\n> drwxr-xr-x  7        224 May 13 18:10 .\n> drwxr-xr-x  4        128 May 18 18:00 ..\n> -rw-r--r--  1      20437 May 20 06:46 LICENSE\n> -rw-r--r--  1   53355492 May 13 18:10 recipes_raw.zip\n> -rw-r--r--  1   49784325 May 20 06:46 recipes_raw_nosource_ar.json\n> -rw-r--r--  1   61133971 May 20 06:46 recipes_raw_nosource_epi.json\n> -rw-r--r--  1   93702755 May 20 06:46 recipes_raw_nosource_fn.json\n> ```\n\nAs you may see, the dataset consists of *3* files. We need to merge information from those *3* files into one dataset later.\n\nLet's load datasets data from `json` files and preview examples from them.\n\n```python\ndef load_dataset(silent=False):\n    # List of dataset files we want to merge.\n    dataset_file_names = [\n        'recipes_raw_nosource_ar.json',\n        'recipes_raw_nosource_epi.json',\n        'recipes_raw_nosource_fn.json',\n    ]\n\n    dataset = []\n\n    for dataset_file_name in dataset_file_names:\n        dataset_file_path = f'{CACHE_DIR}/datasets/{dataset_file_name}'\n\n        with open(dataset_file_path) as dataset_file:\n            json_data_dict = json.load(dataset_file)\n            json_data_list = list(json_data_dict.values())\n            dict_keys = [key for key in json_data_list[0]]\n            dict_keys.sort()\n            dataset += json_data_list\n\n            # This code block outputs the summary for each dataset.\n            if silent == False:\n                print(dataset_file_path)\n                print('===========================================')\n                print('Number of examples: ', len(json_data_list), '\\n')\n                print('Example object keys:\\n', dict_keys, '\\n')\n                print('Example object:\\n', json_data_list[0], '\\n')\n                print('Required keys:\\n')\n                print('  title: ', json_data_list[0]['title'], '\\n')\n                print('  ingredients: ', json_data_list[0]['ingredients'], '\\n')\n                print('  instructions: ', json_data_list[0]['instructions'])\n                print('\\n\\n')\n\n    return dataset\n\ndataset_raw = load_dataset()\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> ./tmp/datasets/recipes_raw_nosource_ar.json\n> ===========================================\n> Number of examples:  39802\n>\n> Example object keys:\n>  ['ingredients', 'instructions', 'picture_link', 'title']\n>\n> Example object:\n>  {'title': 'Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings', 'ingredients': ['4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves ADVERTISEMENT', '2 tablespoons butter ADVERTISEMENT', '2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup ADVERTISEMENT', '1 onion, finely diced ADVERTISEMENT', '2 (10 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough, torn into pieces ADVERTISEMENT', 'ADVERTISEMENT'], 'instructions': 'Place the chicken, butter, soup, and onion in a slow cooker, and fill with enough water to cover.\\nCover, and cook for 5 to 6 hours on High.

We need to clean our dataset from those incomplete examples.\n\nThe following function will help us filter out recipes which don't have either title or ingredients or instructions:\n\n```python\ndef recipe_validate_required_fields(recipe):\n    required_keys = ['title', 'ingredients', 'instructions']\n\n    if not recipe:\n        return False\n\n    for required_key in required_keys:\n        if not recipe[required_key]:\n            return False\n\n        if type(recipe[required_key]) == list and len(recipe[required_key]) == 0:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n```\n\nLet's do the filtering now using `recipe_validate_required_fields()` function:\n\n```python\ndataset_validated = [recipe for recipe in dataset_raw if recipe_validate_required_fields(recipe)]\n\nprint('Dataset size BEFORE validation', len(dataset_raw))\nprint('Dataset size AFTER validation', len(dataset_validated))\nprint('Number of incomplete recipes', len(dataset_raw) - len(dataset_validated))\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Dataset size BEFORE validation 125164\n> Dataset size AFTER validation 122938\n> Number of incomplete recipes 2226\n> ```\n\nAs you may see among `125164` recipes we had `2226` somehow incomplete.\n\n### Converting recipes objects into strings\n\nRNN doesn't understand objects. Therefore, we need to convert recipes objects to string and then to numbers (indices). Let's start with converting recipes objects to strings.\n\nTo help our RNN learn the structure of the text faster let's add 3 \"landmarks\" to it. We will use these unique \"title\", \"ingredients\" and \"instruction\" landmarks to separate the logic sections of each recipe.\n\n```python\nSTOP_WORD_TITLE = '📗 '\nSTOP_WORD_INGREDIENTS = '\\n🥕\\n\\n'\nSTOP_WORD_INSTRUCTIONS = '\\n📝\\n\\n'\n```\n\nThe following function converts the recipe object to a string (sequence of characters) for later usage in RNN input.\n\n```python\ndef recipe_to_string(recipe):\n    # This string is presented as a part of recipes so we need to clean it up.\n    noize_string = 'ADVERTISEMENT'\n\n    title = recipe['title']\n    ingredients = recipe['ingredients']\n    instructions = recipe['instructions'].split('\\n')\n\n    ingredients_string = ''\n    for ingredient in ingredients:\n        ingredient = ingredient.replace(noize_string, '')\n        if ingredient:\n            ingredients_string += f'• {ingredient}\\n'\n\n    instructions_string = ''\n    for instruction in instructions:\n        instruction = instruction.replace(noize_string, '')\n        if instruction:\n            instructions_string += f'▪︎ {instruction}\\n'\n\n    return f'{STOP_WORD_TITLE}{title}\\n{STOP_WORD_INGREDIENTS}{ingredients_string}{STOP_WORD_INSTRUCTIONS}{instructions_string}'\n```\n\nLet's apply `recipe_to_string()` function to `dataset_validated`:\n\n```python\ndataset_stringified = [recipe_to_string(recipe) for recipe in dataset_validated]\n\nprint('Stringified dataset size: ', len(dataset_stringified))\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Stringified dataset size:  122938\n> ```\n\nLet's preview first several recipes:\n\n```python\nfor recipe_index, recipe_string in enumerate(dataset_stringified[:3]):\n    print('Recipe #{}\\n---------'.format(recipe_index + 1))\n    print(recipe_string)\n    print('\\n')\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Recipe #1\n> ---------\n> 📗 Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings\n>\n> 🥕\n>\n> • 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves\n> • 2 tablespoons butter\n> • 2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup\n> • 1 onion, finely diced\n> • 2 (10 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough, torn into pieces\n>\n> 📝\n>\n> ▪︎ Place the chicken, butter, soup, and onion in a slow cooker, and fill with enough water to cover.\n> ▪︎ Cover, and cook for 5 to 6 hours on High.

We need to have one *hard-coded sequence length* limit before feeding recipe sequences to RNN. We need to find out what recipe length will cover most of the recipe use-cases and at the same time we want to keep it as small as possible to speed up the training process.\n\n```python\nrecipes_lengths = []\nfor recipe_text in dataset_stringified:\n    recipes_lengths.append(len(recipe_text))\n\nplt.hist(recipes_lengths, bins=50)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n![Recipes lengths 1](assets/2.png)\n\nMost of the recipes have length less than `5000` characters. Let's zoom in to see more detailed picture:\n\n```python\nplt.hist(recipes_lengths, range=(0, 8000), bins=50)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n![Recipes lengths 2](assets/3.png)\n\nLooks like a limit of `2000` characters for the recipes will cover most of the cases. We may try to train RNN with this maximum recipe length limit.\n\n```python\nMAX_RECIPE_LENGTH = 2000\n```\n\nTherefore, let's filter out all the recipes that are longer than `MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH`:\n\n```python\ndef filter_recipes_by_length(recipe_test):\n    return len(recipe_test) <= MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH\n\ndataset_filtered = [recipe_text for recipe_text in dataset_stringified if filter_recipes_by_length(recipe_text)]\n\nprint('Dataset size BEFORE filtering: ', len(dataset_stringified))\nprint('Dataset size AFTER filtering: ', len(dataset_filtered))\nprint('Number of eliminated recipes: ', len(dataset_stringified) - len(dataset_filtered))\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Dataset size BEFORE filtering:  122938\n> Dataset size AFTER filtering:  100212\n> Number of eliminated recipes:  22726\n> ```\n\nWe lost `22726` recipes during this filtering but now recipes' data is more dense.\n\n### Summarizing dataset parameters\n\n```python\nTOTAL_RECIPES_NUM = len(dataset_filtered)\n\nprint('MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH: ', MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH)\nprint('TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM: ', TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH:  2000\n> TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM:  100212\n> ```\n\nFinally, we ended up with `~100k` recipes. Each recipe has `2000` characters length.\n\n## Creating vocabulary\n\nRecurrent neural network doesn't understand characters or words. It understands numbers instead. Therefore, we need to convert recipe texts to numbers.\n\nIn this experiment we're going to use a **character-level** language model based on multi-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network (as opposed to **word-level** language model). It means that instead of creating unique indices for words we will create unique indices for characters. By doing that we let the network predict the next *character* instead of the next *word* in a sequence.\n\nℹ️ You may find more details about character-level RNNs explanation in the [Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) article by *Andrej Karpathy*:\n\nTo create a vocabulary out of recipes texts we will use [tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text/Tokenizer).\n\nWe also need to come with some unique character that will be treated as a *stop-character* and will indicate the end of a recipe. We need it for recipe generation afterwards since without this stop-character we won't know where the end of a recipe that we're generating is.\n\n```python\nSTOP_SIGN = '␣'\n\ntokenizer = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(\n    char_level=True,\n    filters='',\n    lower=False,\n    split=''\n)\n\n# Stop word is not a part of recipes, but tokenizer must know about it as well.\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts([STOP_SIGN])\n\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts(dataset_filtered)\n\ntokenizer.get_config()\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> {'num_words': None,\n>  'filters':

We expect our LSTM model to learn that whenever it sees the `␣` stop-character it means that the recipe is ended. Once the network will learn this concept it will put stop-character at the end of every newly generated recipe.\n\n### Create TensorFlow dataset\n\nUp until now we were working with the dataset as with the NumPy array.

For example, say the `sequence_length` is `4` and our text is `Hello`. The input sequence would be `Hell`, and the target sequence `ello`.\n\n```python\ndef split_input_target(recipe):\n    input_text = recipe[:-1]\n    target_text = recipe[1:]\n\n    return input_text, target_text\n\ndataset_targeted = dataset.map(split_input_target)\n\nprint(dataset_targeted)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> <MapDataset shapes: ((2000,), (2000,)), types: (tf.int32, tf.int32)>\n> ```\n\nYou may notice from the line above, that now each example in the dataset consists of two tuples: input and target. Let's print an example:\n\n```python\nfor input_example, target_example in dataset_targeted.take(1):\n    print('Input sequence size:', repr(len(input_example.numpy())))\n    print('Target sequence size:', repr(len(target_example.numpy())))\n    print()\n\n    input_stringified = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([input_example.numpy()[:50]])[0]\n    target_stringified = tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([target_example.numpy()[:50]])[0]\n\n    print('Input:  ', repr(''.join(input_stringified)))\n    print('Target: ', repr(''.join(target_stringified)))\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Input sequence size: 2000\n> Target sequence size: 2000\n>\n> Input:   '📗   S l o w   C o o k e r   C h i c k e n   a n d   D u m p l i n g s \\n \\n 🥕 \\n \\n •   4   s k i n l e'\n> Target:  '  S l o w   C o o k e r   C h i c k e n   a n d   D u m p l i n g s \\n \\n 🥕 \\n \\n •   4   s k i n l e s'\n> ```\n\nEach index of these vectors is processed as one time step by RNN. For the input at time step `0`, the model receives the index for `📗` and tries to predict the index for ` ` (a space character) as the next character. At the next time-step, it does the same thing, but the RNN considers the previous step context in addition to the current input character.\n\n```python\nfor i, (input_idx, target_idx) in enumerate(zip(input_example[:10], target_example[:10])):\n    print('Step {:2d}'.format(i + 1))\n    print('  input: {} ({:s})'.format(input_idx, repr(tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([[input_idx.numpy()]])[0])))\n    print('  expected output: {} ({:s})'.format(target_idx, repr(tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([[target_idx.numpy()]])[0])))\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Step  1\n>   input: 51 ('📗')\n>   expected output: 1 (' ')\n> Step  2\n>   input: 1 (' ')\n>   expected output: 33 ('S')\n> Step  3\n>   input: 33 ('S')\n>   expected output: 10 ('l')\n> Step  4\n>   input: 10 ('l')\n>   expected output: 5 ('o')\n> Step  5\n>   input: 5 ('o')\n>   expected output: 23 ('w')\n> Step  6\n>   input: 23 ('w')\n>   expected output: 1 (' ')\n> Step  7\n>   input: 1 (' ')\n>   expected output: 35 ('C')\n> Step  8\n>   input: 35 ('C')\n>   expected output: 5 ('o')\n> Step  9\n>   input: 5 ('o')\n>   expected output: 5 ('o')\n> Step 10\n>   input: 5 ('o')\n>   expected output: 25 ('k')\n> ```\n\n### Split up the dataset into batches\n\nWe have `~100k` recipes in the dataset, and each recipe has two tuples of `2000` characters.\n\n```python\nprint(dataset_targeted)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> <MapDataset shapes: ((2000,), (2000,)), types: (tf.int32, tf.int32)>\n> ```\n\nLet's print constants values:\n\n```python\nprint('TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM: ', TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM)\nprint('MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH: ', MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH)\nprint('VOCABULARY_SIZE: ', VOCABULARY_SIZE)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> TOTAL_RECIPES_NUM:  100212\n> MAX_RECIPE_LENGTH:  2000\n> VOCABULARY_SIZE:  176\n> ```\n\nIf we will feed the complete dataset during the training process to the model and then will try to do a back-propagation for all examples at once we might run out of memory and each training epoch may take too long to execute. To avoid the situation like this we need to split our dataset into batches.\n\n```python\n# Batch size.\nBATCH_SIZE = 64\n\n# Buffer size to shuffle the dataset (TF data is designed to work\n# with possibly infinite sequences, so it doesn't attempt to shuffle\n# the entire sequence in memory. Instead, it maintains a buffer in\n# which it shuffles elements).\nSHUFFLE_BUFFER_SIZE = 1000\n\ndataset_train = dataset_targeted \\\n  # Shuffling examples first.\n  .shuffle(SHUFFLE_BUFFER_SIZE) \\\n  # Splitting examples on batches.\n  .batch(BATCH_SIZE, drop_remainder=True) \\\n  # Making a dataset to be repeatable (it will never ends).\n  .repeat()\n\nprint(dataset_train)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> <RepeatDataset shapes: ((64, 2000), (64, 2000)), types: (tf.int32, tf.int32)>\n> ```\n\nFrom the line above you may notice that our dataset now consists of the same two tuples of `2000` characters but now they are grouped in the batches by `64`.\n\n```python\nfor input_text, target_text in dataset_train.take(1):\n    print('1st batch: input_text:', input_text)\n    print()\n    print('1st batch: target_text:', target_text)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> 1st batch: input_text: tf.Tensor(\n> [[ 51   1  54 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [ 51   1  64 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [ 51   1  44 ... 165 165 165]\n>  ...\n>  [ 51   1  69 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [ 51   1  55 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [ 51   1  70 ... 165 165 165]], shape=(64, 2000), dtype=int32)\n>\n> 1st batch: target_text: tf.Tensor(\n> [[  1  54   4 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [  1  64   5 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [  1  44   6 ... 165 165 165]\n>  ...\n>  [  1  69   3 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [  1  55   3 ... 165 165 165]\n>  [  1  70   2 ... 165 165 165]], shape=(64, 2000), dtype=int32)\n> ```\n\n## Build the model\n\nWe will use [tf.keras.Sequential](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) to define the model. For this experiment we will use the following layer types:\n\n- [tf.keras.layers.Embedding](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding) - the input layer (a trainable lookup table that will map the numbers of each character to a vector with `embedding_dim` dimensions),\n- [tf.keras.layers.LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM) - a type of RNN with size `units=rnn_units` (you can also use a [GRU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/GRU) layer here),\n- [tf.keras.layers.Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) - the output layer, with `VOCABULARY_SIZE` outputs.\n\n### Figuring out how the Embedding Layer works\n\nLet's do a quick detour and see how Embedding Layer works. It takes several char indices sequences (batch) as an input. It encodes every character of every sequence to a vector of `tmp_embedding_size` length.\n\n```python\ntmp_vocab_size = 10\ntmp_embedding_size = 5\ntmp_input_length = 8\ntmp_batch_size = 2\n\ntmp_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()\ntmp_model.add(tf.keras.layers.Embedding(\n  input_dim=tmp_vocab_size,\n  output_dim=tmp_embedding_size,\n  input_length=tmp_input_length\n))\n# The model will take as input an integer matrix of size (batch, input_length).\n# The largest integer (i.e. word index) in the input should be no larger than 9 (tmp_vocab_size).\n# Now model.output_shape == (None, 10, 64), where None is the batch dimension.\ntmp_input_array = np.random.randint(\n  low=0,\n  high=tmp_vocab_size,\n  size=(tmp_batch_size, tmp_input_length)\n)\ntmp_model.compile('rmsprop', 'mse')\ntmp_output_array = tmp_model.predict(tmp_input_array)\n\nprint('tmp_input_array shape:', tmp_input_array.shape)\nprint('tmp_input_array:')\nprint(tmp_input_array)\nprint()\nprint('tmp_output_array shape:',

Model\n\nLet's assemble the model.\n\nℹ️ You may check [Text generation with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation) notebook from TensorFlow documentation for more details

[Text generation with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation) notebook.\n\nThe picture above illustrates GRU network, but you may easily replace GRU with LSTM.\n\n## Trying the model before training\n\nLet's play around with un-trained model to see its interface (what input do we need and what output will we have) and let's see what model predicts before the training:\n\n```python\nfor input_example_batch, target_example_batch in dataset_train.take(1):\n    example_batch_predictions = model(input_example_batch)\n    print(example_batch_predictions.shape,

If probability at position `15` in that vector is, lets say, `0.3` and the probability at position `25` is `1.1` it means that we should better pick the character with the index `25` as next following character.\n\nSince we want our network to generate different recipes (even for the same input), we can't just pick the maximum probability value. In this case we will end up with the same recipe being predicted by the network over and over again. What we will do instead is drawing **samples** from predictions (like the one printed above) by using [tf.random.categorical()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/random/categorical) function. It will bring some fuzziness to the network. For example, let's say we have character `H` as an input, then, by sampling from categorical distribution, our network may predict not only the word `He`, but also words `Hello`, and `Hi` etc.\n\n### Understanding how `tf.random.categorical` works\n\n```python\n# logits is 2-D Tensor with shape [batch_size, num_classes].\n# Each slice [i, :] represents the unnormalized log-probabilities for all classes.\n# In the example below we say that the probability for class \"0\"\n# (element with index 0) is low but the probability for class \"2\" is much higher.\ntmp_logits = [\n  [-0.95, 0, 0.95],\n];\n\n# Let's generate 5 samples. Each sample is a class index. Class probabilities\n# are being taken into account (we expect to see more samples of class \"2\").\ntmp_samples = tf.random.categorical(\n    logits=tmp_logits,\n    num_samples=5\n)\n\nprint(tmp_samples)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> tf.Tensor([[2 1 2 2 1]], shape=(1, 5), dtype=int64)\n> ```\n\n### Sampling from LSTM predictions\n\n```python\nsampled_indices = tf.random.categorical(\n    logits=example_batch_predictions[0],\n    num_samples=1\n)\n\nsampled_indices = tf.squeeze(\n    input=sampled_indices,\n    axis=-1\n).numpy()\n\nsampled_indices.shape\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> (2000,)\n> ```\n\nLet's see some sampled predictions for the first `100` chars of the recipe:\n\n```python\nsampled_indices[:100]\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> array([ 64,  21,  91, 126, 170,  42, 146,  54, 125, 164,  60, 171,   9,\n>         87, 129,  28, 146, 103,  41, 101, 147,   3, 134, 171,   8, 170,\n>        105,   5,  44, 173,   5, 105,  17, 138, 165,  32,  88,  96, 145,\n>         83,  33,  65, 172, 162,   8,  29, 147,  58,  81, 153, 150,  56,\n>        156,  38, 144, 134,  13,  40,  17,  50,  27,  35,  39, 112,  63,\n>        139, 151, 133,  68,  29,  91,   2,  70, 112, 135,  31,  26, 156,\n>        118,  71,  49, 104,  75,  27, 164,  41, 117, 124,  18, 137,  59,\n>        160, 158, 119, 173,  50,  78,  45, 121, 118])\n> ```\n\nWe may see now what our untrained model actually predicts:\n\n```python\nprint('Input:\\n', repr(''.join(tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([input_example_batch[0].numpy()[:50]]))))\nprint()\nprint('Next char prediction:\\n', repr(''.join(tokenizer.sequences_to_texts([sampled_indices[:50]]))))\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Input:\n>  '📗   R e s t a u r a n t - S t y l e   C o l e s l a w   I \\n \\n 🥕 \\n \\n •   1   ( 1 6   o u n c e )   p'\n>\n> Next char prediction:\n>  'H . î ⁄ ă ( “ I º Â 8 ̀ s % ù y “ © 0 ’ ‧ a ì ̀ r ă + o A € o + m × ␣ ︎ ñ ç ‱ !

We will use all data from dataset for training. There is not need to extract test or validation sub-sets in this case.\n\n### Attach an optimizer, and a loss function\n\nWe're going to use [tf.keras.optimizers.Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam) optimizer with [tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/sparse_categorical_crossentropy) loss function to train the model:\n\n```python\n# An objective function.\n# The function is any callable with the signature scalar_loss = fn(y_true, y_pred).\ndef loss(labels, logits):\n    entropy = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(\n      y_true=labels,\n      y_pred=logits,\n      from_logits=True\n    )\n\n    return entropy\n\nexample_batch_loss = loss(target_example_batch, example_batch_predictions)\n\nprint(\"Prediction shape: \", example_batch_predictions.shape, \" # (batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)\")\nprint(\"scalar_loss.shape:      \", example_batch_loss.shape)\nprint(\"scalar_loss:      \", example_batch_loss.numpy().mean())\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```\n> Prediction shape:    (64, 2000, 176)  # (batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size)\n> scalar_loss.shape:   (64, 2000)\n> scalar_loss:         5.1618285\n> ```\n\nLet's finally compile the model:\n\n```python\nadam_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)\n\nmodel.compile(\n    optimizer=adam_optimizer,\n    loss=loss\n)\n```\n\n### Configuring callbacks\n\n#### Early stopping callback\n\nFor model training process we may configure a [tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping) callback. It will stop the training automatically in case if model is not improving for several epochs anymore:\n\n```python\nearly_stopping_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(\n    patience=5,\n    monitor='loss',\n    restore_best_weights=True,\n    verbose=1\n)\n```\n\n#### Model checkpoints callback\n\nLet's also configure a [tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint) checkpoint that will allow us to periodically save trained weights to the file so that we could restore the model from weights afterwards.\n\n```python\n# Create a checkpoints directory.\ncheckpoint_dir = 'tmp/checkpoints'\nos.makedirs(checkpoint_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\ncheckpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, 'ckpt_{epoch}')\ncheckpoint_callback=tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(\n    filepath=checkpoint_prefix,\n    save_weights_only=True\n)\n```\n\n### Execute the training\n\nLet's train our model for `500` epochs with `1500` steps per each epoch. For each epoch step the batch of `64` recipes will be fetched and gradient descent will be executed for those `64` recipes of length `2000` step by step.\n\nIf you're experimenting with training parameters it might make sense to reduce the number of epochs to, let's say `20` along with the number of steps per epoch and then see how the model performs under that conditions. If the model improves its performance you may add more data (steps and epochs) to the training process. It might save you some time while you adjust parameters.\n\n```python\nEPOCHS = 500\nINITIAL_EPOCH = 1\nSTEPS_PER_EPOCH = 1500\n\nprint('EPOCHS:          ', EPOCHS)\nprint('INITIAL_EPOCH:   ', INITIAL_EPOCH)\nprint('STEPS_PER_EPOCH: ', STEPS_PER_EPOCH)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> EPOCHS:           500\n> INITIAL_EPOCH:    1\n> STEPS_PER_EPOCH:  1500\n> ```\n\nLet's launch the training:\n\n```python\nhistory = model.fit(\n    x=dataset_train,\n    epochs=EPOCHS,\n    steps_per_epoch=STEPS_PER_EPOCH,\n    initial_epoch=INITIAL_EPOCH,\n    callbacks=[\n        checkpoint_callback,\n        early_stopping_callback\n    ]\n)\n\n# Saving the trained model to file (to be able to re-use it later).\nmodel_name = 'recipe_generation_rnn_raw.h5'\nmodel.save(model_name, save_format='h5')\n```\n\n### Visualizing training progress\n\n```python\ndef render_training_history(training_history):\n    loss = training_history.history['loss']\n\n    plt.title('Loss')\n    plt.xlabel('Epoch')\n    plt.ylabel('Loss')\n    plt.plot(loss, label='Training set')\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.grid(linestyle='--', linewidth=1, alpha=0.5)\n    plt.show()\n\nrender_training_history(history)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n![Model training progress (first 10 epochs)](assets/6.png)\n\nℹ️ *On the chart above only first 10 epochs are presented.*\n\nWe can see from the chart that model performance is getting better during the training. It means that the model learns to predict next characters in a way that the final sequence looks similar to some real recipe texts.\n\n## Generating recipes\n\n### Restore the model from the latest checkpoint\n\nTo keep this prediction step simple, we will restore the saved model and rebuild it with a batch size of 1. Because of the way the RNN state is passed from time-step to time-step, the model only accepts a fixed batch size once built. To run the model with a different `batch_size`, we need to rebuild the model and restore the weights from the checkpoint.\n\n```python\ntf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> 'tmp/checkpoints/ckpt_1'\n> ```\n\nLet's rebuild the model with batch size of `1` and load trained weights to it:\n\n```python\nsimplified_batch_size = 1\n\nmodel_simplified = build_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, simplified_batch_size)\nmodel_simplified.load_weights(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))\nmodel_simplified.build(tf.TensorShape([simplified_batch_size, None]))\n\nmodel_simplified.summary()\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Model: \"sequential_6\"\n> _________________________________________________________________\n> Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #\n> =================================================================\n> embedding_6 (Embedding)      (1, None, 256)            45056\n> _________________________________________________________________\n> lstm_5 (LSTM)                (1, None, 1024)           5246976\n> _________________________________________________________________\n> dense_5 (Dense)              (1, None, 176)            180400\n> =================================================================\n> Total params: 5,472,432\n> Trainable params: 5,472,432\n> Non-trainable params: 0\n> _________________________________________________________________\n> ```\n\nLet's double check that input shape is simplified:\n\n```python\nmodel_simplified.input_shape\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> (1, None)\n> ```\n\n### The prediction loop\n\nTo use our trained model for recipe generation we need to implement a so-called prediction loop. The following code block generates the text using the loop:\n\n- It starts by choosing a start string, initializing the RNN state and setting the number of characters to generate.\n- It gets the prediction distribution of the next character using the start string, and the RNN state.\n- Then, it uses a categorical distribution to calculate the index of the predicted character. It uses this predicted character as the next input to the model.\n- The RNN state returned by the model is fed back into the model so that it now has more context, instead of only one character. After predicting the next character, the modified RNN states are again fed back into the model, which is how it learns as it gets more context from the previously predicted characters.\n\n![Prediction loop](assets/7.png)\n\n> Image source: [Text generation with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation) notebook.\n\nThe `temperature` parameter here defines how fuzzy or how unexpected the generated recipe is going to be. Low temperatures results in more predictable text. Higher temperatures result in more surprising text. You need to experiment to find the best setting.

The `generate_combinations()` function goes through all possible combinations of the first recipe letters and temperatures. It generates `56` different combinations to help us figure out how the model performs and what temperature is better to use.\n\n```python\ndef generate_combinations(model):\n    recipe_length = 1000\n    try_letters = ['', '\\n', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'O', 'L', 'Mushroom', 'Apple', 'Slow', 'Christmass', 'The', 'Banana', 'Homemade']\n    try_temperature = [1.0, 0.8, 0.4, 0.2]\n\n    for letter in try_letters:\n        for temperature in try_temperature:\n            generated_text = generate_text(\n                model,\n                start_string=letter,\n                num_generate = recipe_length,\n                temperature=temperature\n            )\n            print(f'Attempt: \"{letter}\" + {temperature}')\n            print('-----------------------------------')\n            print(generated_text)\n            print('\\n\\n')\n\n```\n\nTo avoid making this article too long only some of those `56` combinations will be printed below.\n\n```python\ngenerate_combinations(model_simplified)\n```\n\n_<small>➔ output:</small>_\n\n> ```text\n> Attempt: \"A\" + 1.0\n> -----------------------------------\n> 📗 Azzeric Sweet Potato Puree\n>\n> 🥕\n>\n> • 24 large baking potatoes, such as Carn or Marinara or 1 (14-ounce) can pot wine\n> • 1/4 pound unsalted butter, cut into small pieces\n> • 1/2 cup coarsely chopped scallions\n>\n> 📝\n>\n> ▪︎ Bring a large pot of water to a boil, place a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, add All Naucocal Volves.
